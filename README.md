# Django Movie Manager

An web app that queries a Movie Database API ([IMDB Alternative](https://rapidapi.com/rapidapi/api/movie-database-imdb-alternative/details)) and displays results accordingly.  Along with the ability to search for movies, you can also store titles you have seen or have access to in a database (denoting details like Year Released and The Platform you have access to it on).  It's helpful in organizing your Film Watching experience.
