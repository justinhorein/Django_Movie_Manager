# Django Live Project

Django_Live_Project is a web app I built at the Tech Academy (technically as part of an internship for [Prosper I.T. Consulting](https://www.learncodinganywhere.com/ProsperITConsulting)). It's an application that queries a Movie Database API ([IMDB Alternative](https://rapidapi.com/rapidapi/api/movie-database-imdb-alternative/details)) and displays results accordingly.  Along with the ability to search for movies, you can also store titles you have seen or own into a database (denoting details like Year Released and The Platform you have access to it on).  It's here to help you organize your Film Watching experience.   


# Caveats
Fortunately, I was able to include the code with this Live Project as well as a written summary (there is only a written summary for C# Live Project). I originally built this as part of a larger application (composed of many smaller apps).  I have modified this code to include only the app that I wrote.  There are hints of this in the file structure.
